# Changelog

Pre-alpha: expect bugs, and please [report them](https://github.com/usersina/yo3-revival/issues/new/choose).

Each section is a release. To release, add a section at the top, headed by the next version (`## v0.0.2 (date)`), and
push to `main`: the release workflow builds the bundles and publishes the version under that tag, with the section as
its notes. A push whose newest version is already released publishes nothing.

## v0.0.1 (2026-11-09)

The first pre-alpha. A private server for Yu-Gi-Oh! ONLINE 3 (ver. 1.153): log in with the original game client and
duel the computer or your friends. Download the bundle for your system below, unpack it and run `run.cmd` (Windows) or
`./run.sh` (Linux); nothing else to install. Then follow the [README](https://github.com/usersina/yo3-revival#readme).

### What works

- Duels against the computer opponents at Kaiba Corporation and between players (Auto Duel, Create Duel, Single and
  Match Mode with side decks, spectating), on EDOPro's rules engine, in the game's own dialogs and animations. Duel
  logs and replays.
- Edit Deck, the starter deck and nine official decks for Yugi, Jaden and Yusei, banlists and a server-side deck check.
- The shop (booster packs, structure decks, protectors, avatar items) paid in BOOSTERPASS Points earned in duels, card
  trades and rentals.
- Chat rooms and whispers, player search, friends and ignore lists, D-Mail, teams, user events (knockout tournaments).
- A join page (`http://HOST:8080/join`) where friends make their own account in a browser.

### Fixed since the first test builds

- The rules engine ships inside the bundle with its own Node.js: no Node.js, Git or curl to install. A duel whose
  engine can't run ends as a draw instead of stopping at the first Draw Phase.
- The game client no longer crashes after a search (Sangan, and any card that adds from the Deck): the server now
  follows the engine's hand shuffles.
- Creature Swap, Magical Hats, Exchange of the Spirit, stolen tokens and Xyz materials show where the engine has them.
- Hovering a monster shows markers on its equip cards and on the cards that target it.
