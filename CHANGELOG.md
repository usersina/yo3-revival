# Changelog

Pre-alpha: expect bugs, and please [report them](https://github.com/usersina/yo3-revival/issues/new/choose).

Each section is a release. To release, rename the "Unreleased" section at the top to the next version
(`## v0.0.5 (date)`) and push to `main`: the release workflow builds the bundles and publishes the version under that
tag, with the section as its notes. A push whose newest version is already released publishes nothing, so changes can
gather under "Unreleased" first.

Older entries describe their release at the time. For current setup, use the [README](README.md) and
[graphical setup guide](docs/launcher.md). Releases through v0.0.3 predate the graphical launcher and TLS login.

## Unreleased

- **ONLINE** now opens player selection directly. The required connection mod skips the unused original login
  form, including when opening the game through the installed direct-start loader.
- Fixed a local gate disconnect race exposed by automatic login, which could crash the client during connection.

## v0.0.4 (2026-11-10)

A graphical launcher for playing and hosting from one window. Download the bundle for your system, extract the
whole folder, and open **yo3-revival.exe** (Windows) or **yo3-revival** (Linux). Game files are not included;
Linux players also need Wine. This is still a pre-alpha.

### Play, join and host

- **Play** starts your local server automatically, or connects to a saved friend's server. Import a private
  invitation, or enter a server address and confirm its identity before supplying an account key.
- **My server** manages hosting independently of your game. Create accounts, add players and export private
  invitations without stopping hosting. Advanced interface, port and sharing options stay out of the normal flow.
- **Settings** checks your game folder and required connection components before login. Optional **direct launch**
  lets the original game executable or shortcut use your saved connection, with fail-fast component/server checks
  and repair guidance. The original executable and INI stay unchanged.
- **Activity** shows server and game logs. Export the current session or all retained sessions as a diagnostic ZIP,
  with a size/date preview and credential redaction. Nothing is uploaded automatically.
- The sidebar shows the version, Help and GitHub links. Updates are checked at startup; future updates download,
  verify and install a complete bundle **after confirmation**, with recovery to the previous version if startup fails.
- Fresh players receive a legal, selected starting deck automatically. Setup runs only once; existing decks,
  default selections, unfinished decks, and later manual edits or deletions are preserved by automatic setup.
- The launcher uses native Iced controls, icons, question-mark help and four clear pages. Wine options appear only
  on Linux. Starting a server does not request administrator access or change firewall rules.

### Upgrade from v0.0.3 or earlier

**Stop the old server and back up its entire data folder before upgrading.** Extract this bundle into a separate
folder, set the game folder in Settings, then select your existing data folder under **My server → Advanced**
**before starting hosting**. Accounts, cards, BP and records import into SQLite automatically; original JSON files
remain as migration copies. Keep players' local `Documents/Yu-Gi-Oh! ONLINE 3` folders too.

The revival launcher and connection DLL are now required. Accounts sharing one router remain separate through
TLS authentication. Allow the chosen TCP port (**7443** by default); the old raw game ports and browser `/join`
page are retired. Choose each existing account in **Players & invitations**, export its private invitation, and
send it only to its owner. Existing account credentials and player data carry over.

The GUI keeps its preferences and connections in a separate SQLite database in private application storage.
Self-managed server certificates are maintained when starting through the GUI, preserving the private identity key.
Existing launchers from v0.0.3 and earlier have no updater: download this release manually. The
[illustrated setup and upgrade guide](https://github.com/usersina/yo3-revival/blob/main/docs/launcher.md)
walks through the complete process, backups and rollback limits.

### Other fixes

- Changing a trade after confirmation requires both players to approve the new offer. Existing key-based accounts
  can trade, rental offers check ownership, and collections refresh after another session changes them.
- Refusing deletion of an account's last player preserves that player's friends, mail and rentals.
- An unrelated player cannot enter or cancel another pair's duel. Create Duel keeps the host's chosen banlist.
- Exporting another player's invitation does not switch the account used on Play. Start uses saved settings.
- Game exit, hosting after closing/reopening the manager, Unicode game/DLL paths and cold headless startup behave
  correctly. Missing or incompatible connection components stop startup before account login.

## v0.0.3 (2026-11-09)

Fixes a locked main screen and a crash. Download the bundle for your system below, unpack it, copy the `data` folder
from your old one into it (your accounts, cards and decks), and run it as before.

- Fixed: for a player with a friend (or someone ignored), the main screen stayed locked after login: only the chat
  answered clicks. The game was waiting for an old Yu-Gi-Oh! Online 2 step the server didn't answer.
- Fixed: clicking the eagle icon at the top left crashed the game. It now shows your Duelist premium.
- The "Duels are unavailable" message now says what to do with a release bundle (unpack it again) instead of asking
  for Node.js.

## v0.0.2 (2026-11-09)

BOOSTERPASS codes and BP from the host. Download the bundle for your system below, unpack it, copy the `data` folder
from your old one into it (your accounts, cards and decks), and run it as before.

- BOOSTERPASS codes: the host makes codes (`add-code`) that players type in the game's BOOSTERPASS window (Main Menu →
  BOOSTERPASS) for BP, each account once; the game shows the points and "Acquired Duelist premium!".
- `give-bp` gives BP to one player's account. Both work while the server runs, from the server's own PC.
- The admin commands that need the server stopped now say so instead of having their change overwritten.

## v0.0.1 (2026-11-09)

The first pre-alpha. A private server for Yu-Gi-Oh! ONLINE 3 (ver. 1.153): log in with the original game client and
duel the computer or your friends. Download the bundle for your system below, unpack it and run `run.cmd` (Windows) or
`./run.sh` (Linux); nothing else to install. Then follow the [README](https://github.com/usersina/yo3-revival#readme).

### What works

- Duels against the computer opponents at Kaiba Corporation and between players (Auto Duel, Create Duel, Single and
  Match Mode with side decks, spectating), on EDOPro's rules engine, in the game's own dialogs and animations. Duel
  logs and replays.
- Edit Deck, the starter deck and nine official decks for Yugi, Jaden and Yusei, banlists and a server-side deck check.
- The shop (booster packs, structure decks, protectors, avatar items) paid in BOOSTERPASS Points earned in duels, card
  trades and rentals.
- Chat rooms and whispers, player search, friends and ignore lists, D-Mail, teams, user events (knockout tournaments).
- A join page (`http://HOST:8080/join`) where friends make their own account in a browser.

### Fixed since the first test builds

- The rules engine ships inside the bundle with its own Node.js: no Node.js, Git or curl to install. A duel whose
  engine can't run ends as a draw instead of stopping at the first Draw Phase.
- The game client no longer crashes after a search (Sangan, and any card that adds from the Deck): the server now
  follows the engine's hand shuffles.
- Creature Swap, Magical Hats, Exchange of the Spirit, stolen tokens and Xyz materials show where the engine has them.
- Hovering a monster shows markers on its equip cards and on the cards that target it.
